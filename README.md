PQP, which stands for Proximity Query Package, is a library for three types of proximity queries performed on geometric models composed of triangles:

    collision detection - detect whether two models overlap, and optionally, which triangles of the models overlap.
    distance computation - compute the distance between two models, i. e., the length of the shortest translation that makes the models overlap
    tolerance verification - detect whether two models are closer or farther than a tolerance value.

SOLID - Software Library for Interference Detection
SOLID is a software library containing functions for performing intersection tests and proximity queries that are useful in the context of collision detection. Collision detection is the process of detecting pairs of geometric objects that are intersecting or are within a given proximity of each other. In particular, SOLID is useful for detecting collisions between objects that are moving relatively of each other over time. The motions of objects are controlled by the client application, and are not determined or affected by SOLID.

Keep in mind that some OpenGL tutorials are linked to the Resources directory, so they don't stand by themselves (this is done in order to not duplicate large resources such as textures and models across different tutorial directories).
