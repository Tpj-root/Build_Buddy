Now the **only blocker** is Boost.
Now the **only blocker** is Boost.

You have:

* System Boost â†’ 1.74 (Debian 12 default)
* A half-installed Boost 1.83 in `/opt/boost_1_83_0` (missing regex component)

CMake is trying to use `/opt/boost_1_83_0`, but that installation is incomplete.

ðŸ‘‰ Two easy fixes:

---

### **Option 1 â€” Use system Boost (1.74)**

OpenSCAD works fine with â‰¥1.70, so just force CMake to use system libs:

```bash
cmake .. -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=/usr
```

---

### **Option 2 â€” Finish Boost 1.83 install**

If you *really* want 1.83:

```bash
cd /opt/boost_1_83_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/boost_1_83_0
./b2 install
```

This will build and install **all components** including `boost_regex`.
Then rerun CMake:

```bash
cmake .. -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost_1_83_0
```

---

âš¡ Recommendation: **go with Option 1 (system Boost 1.74)** â€” simpler and already OK per `check-dependencies.sh`.
